  <p>
    Jellyfish are among the oldest and most fascinating creatures on Earth, having drifted through the 
    oceans for more than 500 million years‚Äîlong before the dinosaurs appeared. Belonging to the phylum 
    Cnidaria, these soft-bodied, gelatinous animals are found in every ocean, from shallow coastal waters 
    to the deepest trenches of the sea. Despite being called ‚Äúfish,‚Äù jellyfish are not fish at all, as 
    they lack bones, brains, hearts, and gills. Instead, they are made up of more than 90% water, with a 
    body structure that is both delicate and efficient for life in the open ocean.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jellyfish have a simple yet effective body plan that has allowed them to thrive for hundreds of 
    millions of years. Their umbrella-shaped bell pulsates gently to propel them through the water, 
    although they rely largely on ocean currents for movement. Hanging beneath the bell are tentacles 
    lined with specialized stinging cells known as cnidocytes, which they use to capture prey and defend 
    themselves from predators. Their diet mainly consists of plankton, small fish, and other tiny marine 
    organisms, which they paralyze with venom before drawing them into their central mouth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Far from being insignificant drifters, jellyfish play important roles in marine ecosystems. They 
    serve as both predators and prey, helping to maintain balance within oceanic food webs. Some species 
    are bioluminescent, producing their own light in the darkness of the deep sea, while others engage in 
    fascinating symbiotic relationships with algae or small marine creatures. Their adaptability has made 
    them one of the most successful and widespread groups of marine animals in existence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond their ecological significance, jellyfish captivate humans with their beauty and mystery. 
    They are admired for their graceful movements and translucent forms, yet also feared for their painful 
    stings, which in some cases can be life-threatening. Today, jellyfish are not only the subject of 
    scientific research but also inspire art, design, and even biotechnology. As climate change and 
    overfishing alter marine ecosystems, jellyfish populations are expanding in many regions, making them 
    increasingly relevant to both scientists and society at large.

  <p>
    Jellyfish possess one of the simplest yet most efficient body structures in the animal kingdom. 
    Unlike vertebrates, they have no skeleton, brain, heart, or lungs. Their body is composed mainly of a 
    gelatinous substance called mesoglea, which gives them their transparent, soft appearance. The body 
    is organized into two main layers: the outer epidermis and the inner gastrodermis, which surrounds the 
    central digestive cavity. This simple body plan has allowed jellyfish to survive for hundreds of 
    millions of years with very little evolutionary change.
  </p>

  <h3>The Bell</h3>
  <p>
    The bell, or umbrella-shaped structure, is the most recognizable feature of a jellyfish. It is made up 
    largely of mesoglea and functions both as protection and as a means of locomotion. By contracting and 
    relaxing its bell, a jellyfish can push water behind it, creating propulsion. However, their movement 
    is mostly passive, with ocean currents carrying them across great distances. The bell also contains 
    nerve nets‚Äîsimple networks of nerve cells that allow the jellyfish to detect light, touch, and 
    vibrations in the water.
  </p>

  <h3>Tentacles and Stinging Cells</h3>
  <p>
    Jellyfish tentacles are perhaps their most iconic and dangerous feature. These slender, often 
    trailing structures are lined with specialized cells called cnidocytes, which contain tiny, 
    harpoon-like structures called nematocysts. When triggered, nematocysts inject venom into prey or 
    predators, immobilizing small fish, plankton, and other organisms. The strength of a sting varies 
    between species‚Äîsome are harmless to humans, while others, like the box jellyfish, deliver venom 
    potent enough to be deadly.
  </p>

  <h3>The Gastrovascular Cavity</h3>
  <p>
    At the center of a jellyfish is the gastrovascular cavity, which functions as both a stomach and 
    circulatory system. Jellyfish have only one opening that serves as both mouth and anus, through 
    which food enters and waste exits. Their diet primarily consists of plankton and small marine 
    animals, which are paralyzed by their tentacles and transported to the central cavity for digestion. 
    Nutrients are then distributed throughout the jellyfish‚Äôs body by diffusion, since they lack a 
    complex circulatory system.
  </p>

  <h3>Nerve Net and Sense Organs</h3>
  <p>
    While jellyfish do not have a brain, they do possess a decentralized nerve net that allows them to 
    respond to their environment. Some species also have specialized sensory structures called rhopalia, 
    which detect light, orientation, and vibrations. Box jellyfish are especially advanced, with 
    complex eyes that include lenses, retinas, and corneas‚Äîfeatures rarely seen in invertebrates. These 
    adaptations allow jellyfish to sense predators, locate prey, and navigate through their watery world 
    despite their simplicity.
  </p>

  <h3>Life Cycle</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most fascinating aspects of jellyfish biology is their life cycle. Jellyfish undergo 
    complex alternations between the polyp and medusa stages. The polyp stage is sessile, attaching to 
    rocks or other surfaces and reproducing asexually. From these polyps, juvenile medusae known as 
    ephyrae are released, which grow into the adult jellyfish we recognize. This dual-stage life cycle 
    has contributed greatly to their evolutionary success and resilience in changing environments.
  </p>

  <h3>Adaptations</h3>
  <p>
    Jellyfish have developed remarkable adaptations for survival. Their transparent bodies make them 
    nearly invisible in the water, offering protection from predators. Many deep-sea species are 
    bioluminescent, producing light to confuse predators or attract prey. Some jellyfish even host 
    symbiotic algae within their tissues, allowing them to generate energy from sunlight. These 
    biological features highlight not only their simplicity but also their extraordinary adaptability 
    across diverse marine environments.
    </p>

<section id="types">
  <h2>Types of Jellyfish</h2>

  <p>
    Jellyfish are an incredibly diverse group of organisms that belong to the phylum Cnidaria and the class 
    Scyphozoa, although many jellyfish-like creatures are also found in other related classes. They vary 
    greatly in size, color, and behavior, ranging from tiny species that are barely visible to the naked eye 
    to massive giants with tentacles stretching for meters. Despite their differences, all jellyfish share 
    the common feature of a soft, gelatinous body and specialized stinging cells known as cnidocytes, which 
    they use for defense and capturing prey. Understanding the different types of jellyfish provides insights 
    into their evolutionary adaptations, ecological roles, and unique survival strategies.
  </p>

  <h3>True Jellyfish (Scyphozoa)</h3>
  <p>
    The most commonly recognized group, true jellyfish belong to the class Scyphozoa. These are the classic 
    bell-shaped jellyfish seen drifting in oceans around the world. Species like the <em>Aurelia aurita</em>, 
    commonly called the moon jellyfish, are widely studied due to their translucent bodies and relatively 
    simple anatomy. True jellyfish have a distinct medusa stage, during which they display their iconic 
    pulsating bell and long tentacles. They are often found in coastal waters, where they play an important 
    role in marine food webs by feeding on plankton and serving as prey for larger animals.
  </p>

  <h3>Box Jellyfish (Cubozoa)</h3>
  <p>
    Box jellyfish, belonging to the class Cubozoa, are among the most dangerous jellyfish in the world. 
    Unlike most jellyfish, they have a cube-shaped bell and remarkable swimming abilities, which allow them 
    to actively move through the water rather than simply drifting with currents. The most infamous species, 
    <em>Chironex fleckeri</em>, found in the waters of Australia and Southeast Asia, is known for its 
    potentially lethal sting that can cause cardiac arrest in humans within minutes. These jellyfish possess 
    highly developed eyes and nervous systems, enabling them to navigate their environment and hunt prey 
    more efficiently than other species.
  </p>

  <h3>Hydrozoan Jellyfish (Hydrozoa)</h3>
  <p>
    The class Hydrozoa includes many small jellyfish that are often overlooked due to their size and 
    delicate appearance. Unlike Scyphozoans, hydrozoan jellyfish typically have both polyp and medusa stages 
    that are equally prominent in their life cycle. One notable species is the <em>Turritopsis dohrnii</em>, 
    often referred to as the ‚Äúimmortal jellyfish.‚Äù This extraordinary organism has the ability to revert its 
    cells back to a youthful polyp stage after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle and 
    avoiding natural death under favorable conditions. This unique biological feature has drawn significant 
    interest from researchers studying aging and cellular regeneration.
  </p>

  <h3>Staurozoa (Stalked Jellyfish)</h3>
  <p>
    Unlike free-swimming jellyfish, members of the class Staurozoa, or stalked jellyfish, spend much of their 
    lives attached to surfaces such as rocks or seaweed in shallow, cold waters. These jellyfish have a stalk 
    that anchors them to the substrate, giving them a flower-like appearance. Their unusual lifestyle sets 
    them apart from other jellyfish, as they do not drift with ocean currents but instead remain relatively 
    stationary. Although less studied than other groups, stalked jellyfish provide unique insights into the 
    diversity and adaptability of cnidarians.
  </p>

  <h3>Deep-Sea Jellyfish</h3>
  <p>
    The mysterious depths of the ocean host some of the most fascinating jellyfish species, many of which 
    have only recently been discovered thanks to advancements in deep-sea exploration. These jellyfish are 
    often bioluminescent, producing light through chemical reactions that help them attract prey, deter 
    predators, or communicate. Species like the giant jellyfish <em>Nemopilema nomurai</em>, found in the 
    waters of East Asia, can reach over two meters in diameter and weigh up to 200 kilograms. Such enormous 
    jellyfish not only highlight the impressive variety of forms but also underscore their significant 
    ecological impact in marine ecosystems.
  </p>

  <h3>Comb Jellies (Ctenophora) ‚Äì The Look-Alikes</h3>
  <p>
    Though not true jellyfish, comb jellies (phylum Ctenophora) are often mistaken for them due to their 
    translucent, gelatinous bodies. Unlike cnidarian jellyfish, comb jellies do not possess stinging cells. 
    Instead, they use sticky cells called colloblasts to capture prey. They are known for their mesmerizing 
    rows of cilia that refract light into a shimmering rainbow effect as they move through the water. While 
    structurally and evolutionarily different, comb jellies occupy a similar ecological role as predators of 
    plankton and small organisms, making them important components of ocean ecosystems.

  <h2>Ecology & Environment of Jellyfish</h2>

  <p>
    Jellyfish are more than just drifting creatures of the sea; they are dynamic and influential organisms 
    that shape the balance of marine ecosystems in subtle yet powerful ways. Found in every ocean, from 
    shallow coastal lagoons to the deepest abyssal plains, jellyfish interact with their environment in 
    multiple ways‚Äîas predators, prey, competitors, and even ecosystem engineers. Their presence and behavior 
    influence nutrient cycling, food web dynamics, and the health of ocean habitats, making them both 
    ecologically vital and environmentally fascinating.
  </p>

  <h3>Jellyfish in the Marine Food Web</h3>
  <p>
    In the vast tapestry of marine life, jellyfish occupy an important niche. They are voracious feeders, 
    consuming plankton, fish eggs, larvae, and even small fish. This predation helps regulate populations of 
    plankton and prevents uncontrolled growth of microscopic organisms. At the same time, jellyfish themselves 
    are a crucial source of nourishment for many larger predators, including leatherback sea turtles, ocean 
    sunfish (<em>Mola mola</em>), certain seabirds, and even larger jellyfish species. Their dual role as predator 
    and prey positions them at the heart of the marine food chain, where they directly and indirectly affect 
    the survival of countless species.
  </p>

  <h3>Jellyfish Blooms and Their Consequences</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most striking ecological phenomena associated with jellyfish is the occurrence of massive 
    population explosions known as blooms. These events, where millions of jellyfish appear in one region, 
    are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide. Several factors contribute to these blooms: rising sea 
    temperatures due to climate change, overfishing that removes natural predators, nutrient pollution that 
    fuels plankton growth, and the expansion of oxygen-poor ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù where jellyfish thrive but fish 
    cannot survive.
  </p>
  <p>
    The impact of these blooms is complex. On one hand, they provide sudden surges of food for predators and 
    transport organic matter to deeper waters when jellyfish die and sink. On the other hand, they can disrupt 
    human industries by clogging fishing nets, damaging coastal aquaculture farms, and even blocking the 
    intake pipes of power plants. For local ecosystems, these swarms may also outcompete fish for food and 
    alter the natural balance of marine communities.
  </p>

  <h3>Indicators of Environmental Change</h3>
  <p>
    Because jellyfish respond quickly to environmental shifts, they are often seen as natural indicators of 
    ocean health. Their ability to thrive in warm, low-oxygen, and nutrient-rich waters makes them well suited 
    for conditions that are becoming more common due to human influence. As coral reefs bleach and fish 
    populations decline, jellyfish often appear in greater numbers, signaling deeper imbalances in marine 
    ecosystems. Scientists therefore study jellyfish not only as fascinating organisms but also as early 
    warning systems for climate change, overfishing, and ocean pollution.
  </p>

  <h3>Human Impacts and the Rise of Jellyfish</h3>
  <p>
    Human activities have accelerated the spread and abundance of jellyfish in many regions. Overfishing 
    removes predators like turtles and large fish, allowing jellyfish populations to grow unchecked. Plastic 
    pollution poses another major issue: jellyfish often mistake floating plastic bags for food, while sea 
    turtles, in turn, mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. This creates deadly consequences for both. 
    Additionally, the shipping industry spreads jellyfish across oceans through ballast water, sometimes 
    introducing species into environments where they become invasive. Coastal development has also 
    unintentionally benefited jellyfish, as man-made structures such as piers, docks, and oil platforms 
    provide ideal surfaces for jellyfish polyps to attach and grow, giving rise to more frequent blooms.
  </p>

  <h3>The Role of Jellyfish in Ocean Cycles</h3>
  <p>
    Despite the challenges they sometimes pose, jellyfish also contribute to vital ecological processes. When 
    they die and sink to the ocean floor, their bodies deliver a concentrated source of nutrients and carbon 
    to deep-sea ecosystems, feeding scavengers and fueling microbial activity. This process, known as the 
    ‚Äújelly pump,‚Äù plays a role in the global carbon cycle by transporting carbon from surface waters to the 
    deep sea, where it can be stored for long periods. In this way, jellyfish influence not only local food 
    webs but also the global climate system.
  </p>

  <h3>Conservation and the Future of Jellyfish</h3>
  <p>
    Managing jellyfish populations is not straightforward. Unlike fish, they cannot be easily harvested or 
    controlled, and their life cycles involve both free-swimming medusae and stationary polyps that are 
    difficult to track. Conservation efforts focus instead on restoring ecological balance‚Äîprotecting sea 
    turtles and other predators, reducing pollution and overfishing, and better monitoring jellyfish dynamics. 
    Some regions are even turning challenges into opportunities, harvesting jellyfish as a source of food, 
    fertilizers, and medical research materials.

  <h2>Jellyfish & Humans</h2>

  <p>
    The relationship between jellyfish and humans is complex, spanning from dangerous encounters in the 
    ocean to beneficial contributions in science, medicine, and even culture. While they are often feared 
    for their painful stings, jellyfish also provide valuable insights into biology and are increasingly 
    being studied for their potential in biotechnology and environmental monitoring. Their presence in 
    human life is both challenging and inspiring, making them one of the most paradoxical creatures in the 
    marine world.
  </p>

  <h3>Stings and Human Health</h3>
  <p>
    Perhaps the most direct interaction between jellyfish and humans occurs through stings. Jellyfish 
    tentacles are lined with specialized stinging cells called cnidocytes, which release venom through 
    microscopic harpoons known as nematocysts. When swimmers or divers accidentally come into contact 
    with these tentacles, they may experience reactions ranging from mild irritation to excruciating pain. 
    In most cases, stings are not life-threatening, but certain species, such as the Australian box 
    jellyfish (<em>Chironex fleckeri</em>) and the Irukandji jellyfish (<em>Carukia barnesi</em>), can 
    deliver venom potent enough to cause severe systemic reactions and even death if left untreated. 
    Coastal communities in regions with venomous jellyfish often post warnings, and specialized treatments 
    and first-aid protocols have been developed to mitigate risks.
  </p>

  <h3>Impact on Fisheries and Tourism</h3>
  <p>
    Jellyfish blooms‚Äîlarge population explosions‚Äîpose significant challenges to fisheries and coastal 
    economies. Dense swarms of jellyfish can clog fishing nets, damage aquaculture facilities, and consume 
    massive amounts of plankton that would otherwise sustain fish populations. In some cases, jellyfish 
    even prey directly on fish eggs and larvae, further reducing fishery stocks. Beyond fisheries, jellyfish 
    blooms can disrupt tourism when stinging species wash up on beaches in large numbers, deterring 
    swimmers and divers. This economic impact has prompted greater research into the environmental factors 
    that trigger jellyfish outbreaks, such as rising sea temperatures, overfishing of natural predators, 
    and nutrient pollution.
  </p>

  <h3>Jellyfish in Science and Medicine</h3>
  <p>
    Despite their negative reputation, jellyfish have made remarkable contributions to science. One of the 
    most important discoveries in modern biology‚Äîthe green fluorescent protein (GFP)‚Äîwas first isolated from 
    the jellyfish <em>Aequorea victoria</em>. GFP revolutionized cellular and molecular biology by allowing 
    scientists to track the expression of genes and proteins with glowing markers, earning a Nobel Prize in 
    2008. Today, GFP and its derivatives are essential tools in biomedical research, including cancer 
    studies, neuroscience, and drug development. Beyond GFP, scientists are exploring jellyfish venom for 
    its potential therapeutic applications, such as painkillers, heart medications, and anticancer compounds.
  </p>

  <h3>Cultural and Culinary Significance</h3>
  <p>
    In several Asian countries, jellyfish are considered a delicacy and have been consumed for centuries. 
    Certain species are processed into a dried or pickled form and used in salads or traditional dishes. 
    Rich in collagen and low in fat, jellyfish are sometimes promoted as a health food, although proper 
    preparation is necessary to remove toxins. Culturally, jellyfish also feature in mythology, art, and 
    symbolism, often representing themes of transformation, fragility, or the mysteries of the sea. Their 
    mesmerizing, ethereal beauty has inspired artists, writers, and filmmakers, making them both feared and 
    admired in human imagination.
  </p>

  <h3>Biotechnology and Environmental Monitoring</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond the laboratory, jellyfish are now being studied for their potential applications in sustainable 
    technology and environmental science. Researchers are investigating how jellyfish mucus can trap 
    microplastics, offering a possible method for cleaning polluted waters. Their collagen is being tested 
    for use in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, while their bioluminescence continues to 
    inspire innovations in imaging technology. At the same time, jellyfish populations are increasingly 
    viewed as indicators of ecosystem change. Their ability to thrive in warm, oxygen-poor, and polluted 
    waters makes them important bioindicators of environmental stress in marine systems.

  <h2>Research & Biotechnology</h2>

  <p>
    Modern research on jellyfish sits at the intersection of classical marine biology and cutting-edge genomics and computational biology. 
    Over the past decade, whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing projects, combined with proteomics and structural modelling, have transformed 
    our understanding of how jellyfish develop, hunt, envenomate, and evolve. These advances enable applied outcomes ‚Äî from better clinical 
    treatments for stings to novel biotechnologies derived from unique jellyfish proteins ‚Äî while also illuminating deep evolutionary questions 
    about the origins of animal body plans and nervous systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Genome sequencing projects </h3>
  <p>
    Genome sequencing projects produce foundational reference datasets that allow researchers to link genes to traits such as venom production,
    sensory organ development, and life cycle control. For example, the genome of the giant Nomura‚Äôs jellyfish (<em>Nemopilema nomurai</em>) 
    provided the first genome-scale view into the gene families responsible for active predation and venom components, revealing expansions 
    in proteases and pore-forming toxin families that are concentrated in tentacle and nematocyst tissues. These genomic data are particularly 
    valuable when paired with proteomics of venom extracts and high-resolution transcriptomes from tentacles and nematocyst structures, as they 
    enable investigators to map toxin transcripts to protein products and to identify enzymatic classes (metalloproteases, phospholipases, pore-formers) 
    that drive dermonecrosis and systemic toxicity. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Complementing this, sequencing the genome of the moon jelly (<em>Aurelia aurita</em>) and other medusozoans has given researchers critical insight 
    into the genetic underpinnings of medusa-specific features ‚Äî notably nervous system components, sensory organ (rhopalia) development, and 
    gene families involved in muscle-like contractile function that power bell pulsation. Comparative analysis across medusozoan genomes shows that 
    many developmental gene families are conserved but that lineage-specific expansions and regulatory changes underlie the origin of the 
    free-swimming medusa. These genomes therefore serve two purposes: (1) they identify toxin and venom-related genes that can be prioritized for 
    structural and functional work, and (2) they provide the evolutionary context to study how nervous systems and sensory organs evolved in early animals.
  </p>

  <h3>Bioinformatics & computational roles</h3>
  <p>
    Bioinformatics is central to modern jellyfish research. Comparative genomics ‚Äî the systematic comparison of gene content, synteny, and gene-family 
    evolution across multiple cnidarian genomes ‚Äî helps reconstruct ancestral gene repertoires and reveal which gene changes correlate with the 
    evolution of novel traits (venom complexity, image-forming eyes, medusa body plan). Phylogenomic pipelines that combine orthology assignment 
    (e.g., OrthoFinder/OrthoMCL), multiple sequence alignment, and species-tree inference are commonly used to place jellyfish genes into an 
    evolutionary context and to test hypotheses about gene family expansions related to envenomation or bioluminescence. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For venom science specifically, modern workflows combine deep transcriptomics, proteomics, and structural bioinformatics. Transcriptomes from 
    tentacles and isolated nematocysts produce candidate toxin sequences; mass spectrometry-based proteomics validates which peptides are present 
    in venom; and protein-structure prediction (homology modelling, Rosetta, and modern AI approaches) allows researchers to generate molecular models 
    for pore-forming toxins and metalloproteases. These structural models guide mutational experiments, epitope mapping for antivenom development, 
    and in silico screening of small-molecule or peptide inhibitors that may blunt venom activity. Structural work on CfTX-like proteins (box jelly toxins) 
    and predicted helical/pore-forming regions has been especially informative for hypothesizing how toxins disrupt cardiac and cellular membranes.
  </p>

  <h3>Phylogenetics of bioluminescence and related gene families</h3>
  <p>
    Bioluminescence in cnidarians is distributed across lineages and is encoded by a range of luciferases, photoproteins, and accessory genes. 
    Phylogenetic studies that assemble luciferase/photoprotein families across taxa‚Äîpaired with expression data‚Äîallow researchers to infer whether 
    bioluminescence arose multiple times independently or via horizontal transfer, and which domain architectures correlate with particular light-emission chemistries. 
    Combining gene trees with species trees also helps identify lineage-specific duplications that gave rise to novel light-emitting phenotypes. 
  </p>

  <h3> Workflow </h3>
  <p>
    A typical research workflow that links genomes to toxin biology and evolution looks like this: (1) sample collection and tissue-specific RNA-seq 
    (tentacles, nematocysts, rhopalia), (2) genome and transcriptome assembly (long reads + short-read polishing), (3) gene annotation and secretome 
    prediction (signal peptides, secretory protein filters), (4) venom proteomics (LC‚ÄìMS/MS) to validate secreted toxins, (5) structural prediction and 
    in silico docking for candidate inhibitors, and (6) comparative genomics / phylogenetics to place novel toxins in an evolutionary framework. 
    This integrative pipeline enables studies that directly inform medical responses to stings, antivenom design, and the discovery of bioactive molecules 
    with therapeutic potential.

  <h2>Case Studies: Jellyfish Toxins & Clinical Reports</h2>

  <p>
    Jellyfish envenomation spans a wide clinical spectrum from mild local pain to severe systemic reactions and, in rare cases, fatality.
    Case studies‚Äîranging from individual clinical reports to proteomic analyses of venom‚Äîprovide the most direct link between
    jellyfish biology and human health. The papers below have been chosen to represent important case studies and investigations into
    venom composition, mechanisms of action, clinical presentation (including Irukandji and box jellyfish syndromes), and treatment or
