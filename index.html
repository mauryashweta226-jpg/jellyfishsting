  <h2>About Jellyfish</h2>
<!-- Jellyfish Images -->

  <p>
    Jellyfish are among the most ancient and fascinating creatures in the ocean, drifting through 
    Earth’s waters for over <strong>500 million years</strong>—making them older than dinosaurs and 
    even trees. Despite their name, jellyfish are not fish at all; they belong to the phylum 
    <em>Cnidaria</em>, a group of animals that also includes corals and sea anemones.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their bodies are composed of about <strong>95–98% water</strong>, giving them their 
    translucent, gelatinous form. They lack bones, a heart, or even a brain, yet they have survived 
    for millions of years thanks to specialized structures such as 
    <em>cnidocytes</em>—tiny stinging cells that help them capture prey and defend against predators.
  </p>

  <p>
    Found in oceans all around the world, from shallow coastal waters to the deepest seas, jellyfish 
    come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Some are barely visible to the naked eye, 
    while others, like the giant <em>Nomura’s jellyfish</em>, can grow over two meters in diameter. 
    Their pulsating movements and bioluminescent glow make them one of the most captivating sights 
    in marine ecosystems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ecologically, jellyfish play vital roles: they are predators of plankton and small fish, prey 
    for turtles and larger marine species, and recyclers of nutrients in the ocean. However, large 
    blooms of jellyfish can sometimes disrupt human activities by clogging fishing nets, damaging 
    coastal industries, or even affecting power plant operations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond their ecological significance, jellyfish are also of great scientific interest. 
    Their simple nervous systems, unique proteins such as <em>Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)</em>, 
    and complex venom compositions have inspired research in fields ranging from biotechnology 
    and neuroscience to medicine.
  </p>
</section>

  <main>
    <section id="biology">
  <h2>Biology & Anatomy of Jellyfish</h2>

  <p>
    Jellyfish possess one of the simplest yet most effective body designs in the animal kingdom. 
    Their bodies are radially symmetrical and consist of three main layers: the outer layer 
    (<em>epidermis</em>), the middle gelatinous layer (<em>mesoglea</em>), and the inner layer 
    (<em>gastrodermis</em>). Despite their apparent fragility, these structures allow jellyfish 
    to survive in diverse marine environments, from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most recognizable part of a jellyfish is the <strong>bell</strong>, or umbrella-shaped 
    structure, which pulsates rhythmically to propel the organism through the water. Hanging 
    from the bell are <strong>tentacles</strong> lined with stinging cells known as 
    <em>cnidocytes</em>. These cells contain <em>nematocysts</em>, microscopic harpoons loaded 
    with venom, which can paralyze or kill small prey within milliseconds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike most animals, jellyfish do not have a centralized brain or heart. Instead, they rely on 
    a simple nerve net—a decentralized system of sensory structures that detect light, gravity, 
    vibrations, and chemical cues in the water. This enables them to respond quickly to their 
    surroundings despite their simplicity. Some species also have specialized organs called 
    <strong>rhopalia</strong>, which house light-sensitive cells and balance sensors, giving them 
    a basic sense of orientation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The central cavity of the jellyfish is the <strong>gastrovascular cavity</strong>, which acts as 
    both a stomach and a circulatory system. Food is captured by the tentacles and moved into the 
    cavity, where digestion occurs. Nutrients are then distributed throughout the body by diffusion, 
    as jellyfish lack a true circulatory system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jellyfish also exhibit fascinating variations in their <strong>reproductive biology</strong>. 
    Most species undergo an <em>alternation of generations</em>, switching between a sessile polyp 
    stage and a free-swimming medusa stage. Polyps reproduce asexually by budding, while medusae 
    reproduce sexually, releasing eggs and sperm into the water. This dual strategy has allowed 
    jellyfish to adapt and thrive in changing environments for millions of years.
  </p>

  <p>
    Size and morphology can vary drastically between species. While tiny hydromedusae are only a 
    few millimeters across, the giant <em>Cyanea capillata</em> (Lion’s Mane Jellyfish) can have 
    tentacles extending over 30 meters in length. Some species, like the <em>box jellyfish</em>, 
    even possess clusters of well-developed eyes capable of forming crude images, an evolutionary 
    marvel given their lack of a brain.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short, jellyfish anatomy showcases how <strong>evolution can favor simplicity and efficiency</strong>. 
    Their unique biological systems continue to fascinate scientists, providing valuable insights 
    into neurology, regeneration, and the evolution of multicellular life.

<section id="types">
  <h2>Types of Jellyfish</h2>

  <p>
    Jellyfish are an incredibly diverse group of organisms that belong to the phylum Cnidaria and the class 
    Scyphozoa, although many jellyfish-like creatures are also found in other related classes. They vary 
    greatly in size, color, and behavior, ranging from tiny species that are barely visible to the naked eye 
    to massive giants with tentacles stretching for meters. Despite their differences, all jellyfish share 
    the common feature of a soft, gelatinous body and specialized stinging cells known as cnidocytes, which 
    they use for defense and capturing prey. Understanding the different types of jellyfish provides insights 
    into their evolutionary adaptations, ecological roles, and unique survival strategies.
  </p>

  <h3>True Jellyfish (Scyphozoa)</h3>
  <p>
    The most commonly recognized group, true jellyfish belong to the class Scyphozoa. These are the classic 
    bell-shaped jellyfish seen drifting in oceans around the world. Species like the <em>Aurelia aurita</em>, 
    commonly called the moon jellyfish, are widely studied due to their translucent bodies and relatively 
    simple anatomy. True jellyfish have a distinct medusa stage, during which they display their iconic 
    pulsating bell and long tentacles. They are often found in coastal waters, where they play an important 
    role in marine food webs by feeding on plankton and serving as prey for larger animals.
  </p>

  <h3>Box Jellyfish (Cubozoa)</h3>
  <p>
    Box jellyfish, belonging to the class Cubozoa, are among the most dangerous jellyfish in the world. 
    Unlike most jellyfish, they have a cube-shaped bell and remarkable swimming abilities, which allow them 
    to actively move through the water rather than simply drifting with currents. The most infamous species, 
    <em>Chironex fleckeri</em>, found in the waters of Australia and Southeast Asia, is known for its 
    potentially lethal sting that can cause cardiac arrest in humans within minutes. These jellyfish possess 
    highly developed eyes and nervous systems, enabling them to navigate their environment and hunt prey 
    more efficiently than other species.
  </p>

  <h3>Hydrozoan Jellyfish (Hydrozoa)</h3>
  <p>
    The class Hydrozoa includes many small jellyfish that are often overlooked due to their size and 
    delicate appearance. Unlike Scyphozoans, hydrozoan jellyfish typically have both polyp and medusa stages 
    that are equally prominent in their life cycle. One notable species is the <em>Turritopsis dohrnii</em>, 
    often referred to as the “immortal jellyfish.” This extraordinary organism has the ability to revert its 
    cells back to a youthful polyp stage after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle and 
    avoiding natural death under favorable conditions. This unique biological feature has drawn significant 
    interest from researchers studying aging and cellular regeneration.
  </p>

  <h3>Staurozoa (Stalked Jellyfish)</h3>
  <p>
    Unlike free-swimming jellyfish, members of the class Staurozoa, or stalked jellyfish, spend much of their 
    lives attached to surfaces such as rocks or seaweed in shallow, cold waters. These jellyfish have a stalk 
    that anchors them to the substrate, giving them a flower-like appearance. Their unusual lifestyle sets 
    them apart from other jellyfish, as they do not drift with ocean currents but instead remain relatively 
    stationary. Although less studied than other groups, stalked jellyfish provide unique insights into the 
    diversity and adaptability of cnidarians.
  </p>

  <h3>Deep-Sea Jellyfish</h3>
  <p>
    The mysterious depths of the ocean host some of the most fascinating jellyfish species, many of which 
    have only recently been discovered thanks to advancements in deep-sea exploration. These jellyfish are 
    often bioluminescent, producing light through chemical reactions that help them attract prey, deter 
    predators, or communicate. Species like the giant jellyfish <em>Nemopilema nomurai</em>, found in the 
    waters of East Asia, can reach over two meters in diameter and weigh up to 200 kilograms. Such enormous 
    jellyfish not only highlight the impressive variety of forms but also underscore their significant 
    ecological impact in marine ecosystems.
  </p>

  <h3>Comb Jellies (Ctenophora) – The Look-Alikes</h3>
  <p>
    Though not true jellyfish, comb jellies (phylum Ctenophora) are often mistaken for them due to their 
    translucent, gelatinous bodies. Unlike cnidarian jellyfish, comb jellies do not possess stinging cells. 
    Instead, they use sticky cells called colloblasts to capture prey. They are known for their mesmerizing 
    rows of cilia that refract light into a shimmering rainbow effect as they move through the water. While 
    structurally and evolutionarily different, comb jellies occupy a similar ecological role as predators of 
    plankton and small organisms, making them important components of ocean ecosystems.
  </p>    
</section>


<section id="ecology">
  <h2>Ecology & Environment of Jellyfish</h2>

  <p>
    Jellyfish are more than just drifting creatures of the sea; they are dynamic and influential organisms 
    that shape the balance of marine ecosystems in subtle yet powerful ways. Found in every ocean, from 
    shallow coastal lagoons to the deepest abyssal plains, jellyfish interact with their environment in 
    multiple ways—as predators, prey, competitors, and even ecosystem engineers. Their presence and behavior 
    influence nutrient cycling, food web dynamics, and the health of ocean habitats, making them both 
    ecologically vital and environmentally fascinating.
  </p>

  <h3>Jellyfish in the Marine Food Web</h3>
  <p>
    In the vast tapestry of marine life, jellyfish occupy an important niche. They are voracious feeders, 
    consuming plankton, fish eggs, larvae, and even small fish. This predation helps regulate populations of 
    plankton and prevents uncontrolled growth of microscopic organisms. At the same time, jellyfish themselves 
    are a crucial source of nourishment for many larger predators, including leatherback sea turtles, ocean 
    sunfish (<em>Mola mola</em>), certain seabirds, and even larger jellyfish species. Their dual role as predator 
    and prey positions them at the heart of the marine food chain, where they directly and indirectly affect 
    the survival of countless species.
  </p>

  <h3>Jellyfish Blooms and Their Consequences</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most striking ecological phenomena associated with jellyfish is the occurrence of massive 
    population explosions known as blooms. These events, where millions of jellyfish appear in one region, 
    are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide. Several factors contribute to these blooms: rising sea 
    temperatures due to climate change, overfishing that removes natural predators, nutrient pollution that 
    fuels plankton growth, and the expansion of oxygen-poor “dead zones” where jellyfish thrive but fish 
    cannot survive.
  </p>
  <p>
    The impact of these blooms is complex. On one hand, they provide sudden surges of food for predators and 
    transport organic matter to deeper waters when jellyfish die and sink. On the other hand, they can disrupt 
    human industries by clogging fishing nets, damaging coastal aquaculture farms, and even blocking the 
    intake pipes of power plants. For local ecosystems, these swarms may also outcompete fish for food and 
    alter the natural balance of marine communities.
  </p>

  <h3>Indicators of Environmental Change</h3>
  <p>
    Because jellyfish respond quickly to environmental shifts, they are often seen as natural indicators of 
    ocean health. Their ability to thrive in warm, low-oxygen, and nutrient-rich waters makes them well suited 
    for conditions that are becoming more common due to human influence. As coral reefs bleach and fish 
    populations decline, jellyfish often appear in greater numbers, signaling deeper imbalances in marine 
    ecosystems. Scientists therefore study jellyfish not only as fascinating organisms but also as early 
    warning systems for climate change, overfishing, and ocean pollution.
  </p>

  <h3>Human Impacts and the Rise of Jellyfish</h3>
  <p>
    Human activities have accelerated the spread and abundance of jellyfish in many regions. Overfishing 
    removes predators like turtles and large fish, allowing jellyfish populations to grow unchecked. Plastic 
    pollution poses another major issue: jellyfish often mistake floating plastic bags for food, while sea 
    turtles, in turn, mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. This creates deadly consequences for both. 
    Additionally, the shipping industry spreads jellyfish across oceans through ballast water, sometimes 
    introducing species into environments where they become invasive. Coastal development has also 
    unintentionally benefited jellyfish, as man-made structures such as piers, docks, and oil platforms 
    provide ideal surfaces for jellyfish polyps to attach and grow, giving rise to more frequent blooms.
  </p>

  <h3>The Role of Jellyfish in Ocean Cycles</h3>
  <p>
    Despite the challenges they sometimes pose, jellyfish also contribute to vital ecological processes. When 
    they die and sink to the ocean floor, their bodies deliver a concentrated source of nutrients and carbon 
    to deep-sea ecosystems, feeding scavengers and fueling microbial activity. This process, known as the 
    “jelly pump,” plays a role in the global carbon cycle by transporting carbon from surface waters to the 
    deep sea, where it can be stored for long periods. In this way, jellyfish influence not only local food 
    webs but also the global climate system.
  </p>

  <h3>Conservation and the Future of Jellyfish</h3>
  <p>
    Managing jellyfish populations is not straightforward. Unlike fish, they cannot be easily harvested or 
    controlled, and their life cycles involve both free-swimming medusae and stationary polyps that are 
    difficult to track. Conservation efforts focus instead on restoring ecological balance—protecting sea 
    turtles and other predators, reducing pollution and overfishing, and better monitoring jellyfish dynamics. 
    Some regions are even turning challenges into opportunities, harvesting jellyfish as a source of food, 
    fertilizers, and medical research materials.
